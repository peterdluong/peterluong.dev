## Primary Style Applications

Background and Sections:

- Use <text style="background-color: #50C878">#50C878</text> for large sections like banners or footers, where you want to create a calming, nature-inspired backdrop.
- Alternatively, apply <text style="background-color: #00C5FF">#00C5FF</text> in backgrounds for tech-oriented sections, showcasing innovation and modernity.

Buttons and Call-to-Actions (CTAs):

- Highlight buttons with <text style="background-color: #FB9A54">#FB9A54</text> to draw attention. Since orange is vibrant and energetic, it encourages clicks and user interaction.
- Consider using <text style="background-color: #50C878">#50C878</text> for secondary CTAs, like links or hover effects.

Text:

- Use <text style="background-color: #00C5FF">#00C5FF</text> for headings or important text. This cyan works well to grab attention without overwhelming the reader.
- Stick to neutral or dark colors for body text (e.g., shades of gray or black) to maintain readability against these bright hues.

Icons and Accent Elements:

- Incorporate <text style="background-color: #FB9A54">#FB9A54</text> (orange) and <text style="background-color: #00C5FF">#00C5FF</text> (cyan) in smaller design elements such as icons, borders, or separators to add pops of color and personality.
- These can also serve as hover effects or active states for interactive elements.

Navigation Bar:

- Use a neutral background with <text style="background-color: #50C878">#50C878</text> or <text style="background-color: #00C5FF">#00C5FF</text> for text or icons, ensuring that the bar remains visible but not too overpowering.

## Secondary Style Applications

Purple (<text style="background-color: #A459FF">#A459FF</text>)

- Why it works: Purple adds a creative, futuristic feel, often associated with technology and innovation. It pairs well with both cyan and green for a modern look.
- Use: Apply it in icons, accent lines, or hover states for a pop of creativity.

Bright Yellow (<text style="background-color: #FFEB3B">#FFEB3B</text>)

- Why it works: Yellow brings in a burst of energy and excitement, making the design feel more playful and engaging.
- Use: Use it for small highlights, such as button text, notification badges, or icons.

Soft Gray (<text style="background-color: #F0F0F0">#F0F0F0</text> or <text style="background-color: #E0E0E0">#E0E0E0</text>)

- Why it works: A light gray gives balance and allows your brighter colors to stand out without overwhelming the design.
- Use: For backgrounds, cards, or sections to keep the page clean and uncluttered.

Magenta (<text style="background-color: #FF4081">#FF4081</text>)

- Why it works: Magenta is bold and fun, creating a striking contrast with your green and cyan. It also adds a futuristic touch.
- Use: In interactive elements like buttons, hover effects, or highlights in graphs/charts.

Dark Navy (<text style="background-color: #1A1A40">#1A1A40</text>)

- Why it works: Navy or deep blue provides a solid, professional foundation to offset the brightness of your primary colors, ensuring that the site doesn’t feel too chaotic.
- Use: For text, headers, or background elements when you need something to ground your design.

Teal (<text style="background-color: #20C997">#20C997</text>)

- Why it works: Teal combines the refreshing qualities of cyan with a bit of sophistication. It complements both your green and cyan for a cohesive yet techy look.
- Use: Accent color for buttons, highlights, or background contrasts.

## Font Styles: Poppins & Nunito Sans (Google Fonts)

Why It Works:

- Consistency in Style: Both Poppins and Nunito Sans are sans-serif fonts with geometric, rounded characteristics, making them visually cohesive. The slight roundness of Nunito Sans complements Poppins' geometric shapes, giving your website a clean, approachable look.
- Friendly and Modern: Both fonts convey a modern, friendly vibe, perfect for a techy, fun atmosphere. Poppins is bolder and sharper for headings, while Nunito Sans, with its slightly softer edges, offers high readability and warmth for body text.
- Readability: Nunito Sans is highly legible, especially on screens, so it works great for body text. It balances out the boldness of Poppins, ensuring that your website is not too overwhelming or heavy in text.
- Versatility: This combination is versatile across various types of content—whether for long-form text or minimal designs. Nunito Sans’ lighter weight options give it flexibility for different sizes and usages, from small captions to longer paragraphs.

When to Use It:

- Headings: Use Poppins for headings and important titles. Its bold, geometric nature will draw attention and establish a hierarchy.
- Body Text: Use Nunito Sans for body copy, forms, and smaller text elements, where clarity and readability are essential.
